What do you really understand from SSH keys in VCS? What are the advantages of using it?

SSH keys are a pair a public and private keys which are used to authenticate and establish a safe connection between client and a remote machine over the internet.

They are resistent to brute force attacks and protect against certain attack vendors used to gain access over remote machines.They also ensure that passwords need not be sent over the network hence provide additional security.
